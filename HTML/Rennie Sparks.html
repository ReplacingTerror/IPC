                    <span style="font-size: 10pt; user-select: auto;">The Handsome Family&#39;s unique variety of alt-country and Americana music has been leaving its mark on listeners since the group&#39;s formation in 1993. The band is made up of married couple Rennie and Brett Sparks. You may be familiar with their song &quot;Far from Any Road,&quot; which served as the theme song for Season 1 of True Detective. We cannot recommend this group&#39;s music strongly enough, and our personal favorite albums are Odessa and Through the Trees.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

We have one or two suspiciously good pizza parlors in ABQ that I assume are run by people in witness protection programs. I&rsquo;m from NY and I expect a line of orange grease to drip down my hand when I fold a slice. I lived in Chicago for 12 years. They make you wait 40 minutes for those souffl&eacute;&rsquo;s they call Chicago style. No way. Those things take 8-10 years to digest.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

I don&rsquo;t know how it turned into a drink here, but in Europe everyone knows this is the basic pie (cheese, sauce, crust). In Ireland we had chicken curry pizza. It was raining and we suffered through though I think it was the filling from an old sandwich cooked on a slightly pizza like platform. I&rsquo;ve seen a lot of curry powder on pizza in Europe. I see a lot of fresh rocket (arugula), &lsquo;white&rsquo; anchovies&rsquo; and a lot of canned corn. Pizza in Italy was not pizza as we know it, but it was good. I&rsquo;ve only eaten one thing I didn&rsquo;t like in Italy: a breaded chicken cutlet sandwich in Ravenna that I ate on the street surrounded by old men watching every bite go into my mouth. And, I never ended up seeing the old mosaics.</span></span></span></span></span></p>

Your song The Giant of Illinois (from the album Through The Trees) has some absolutely beautiful lyrics and is a favorite among members of our club.

He murdered a swan one night when he couldn&rsquo;t find a woman to kill. Robert Wadlow was known as the gentle giant. I guess somewhere between those two ideals we find ourselves? I did realize many years later that the reason the sky was a woman&rsquo;s arms was that I wanted to build a hug big enough for poor Robert who was 6ft tall by the time he was six.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></p>

I wanted to try both (obviously) but the other girls didn&rsquo;t even eat&nbsp; all of their first slices. So I refrained. I regret it to this day and now am able to take a slice of something without waiting for the entire room to eat first so I think I could handle Leo Tolstoy and Rasputin. Leo would eat nothing but freshly picked berries and Rasputin would eat all the pizza and then rub his greasy fingers into his hair. I imagine they would argue a lot and I could just hang out and watch the fun. I suppose I&rsquo;d have to learn Russian first. How would I explain pizza to these two: it is godly to eat a meal that requires no plate, fork or spoon. Maybe we&rsquo;d eat naked in a kind of nineteenth century Russian hippie/peasant way. Surely this is how they ate in the originally holy garden? We&rsquo;ll see how long it takes for one of them to ask about Eden&rsquo;s pizza oven. I suspect neither one of them ever cooked anything so I could tell them a pizza oven is a naturally occurring rock formation. Now if I wanted this party to get really fun I&rsquo;d add Jerzy Kosinski so he could offer recipes he survived on while wandering the forests of Poland hiding from Nazis (as described in &ldquo;The Painted Bird). Not sure that Tolstoy and Rasputin would let me and Jerzy (two jews) pick first slice. Maybe we order two smaller pies marked Jew and non-Jew? I&rsquo;ll work it out. That&rsquo;s a lot of great men who probably wouldn&rsquo;t be that excited to hang with me. I&rsquo;m no Czarnina.&nbsp; So... I guess it couldn&rsquo;t hurt to invite Jack Kerouac. He wouldn&rsquo;t eat anything, just scowl in the corner while chugging Canadian whiskey. I don&rsquo;t think he&rsquo;d liked any of us. Least of all Rasputin who would probably convince drunk Kerouac that the best part is the crust. We keep eating until someone decides it&rsquo;s time to try and kill Rasputin. I&rsquo;m sure he was insufferable.&nbsp;</span></span></span></span></span></p>
