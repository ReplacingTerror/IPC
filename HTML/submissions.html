<div style="font-size: medium;text-align: left">Genuine Gold is a literary magazine produced by the Indiana Pizza Club that strives to publish high-quality, yet unpretentious, poems and short stories from Indiana writers. Obviously we are wild about pizza (It is the greatest food in the world.), but this magazine is dedicated to another couple of our passions - poetry and literature. Even though we are run by The Indiana Pizza Club, we have no specific interest in poems or stories about pizza. In fact, we aren’t particularly interested at all in pieces that deal with our favorite food. (We know that’s weird!)

<br>
<div style="font-size: medium;text-align: left">
Instead, we’re looking for poems of any length and short stories of no more than 1500 words that reflect creativity and unique perspectives on life. We welcome submissions of up to 3 poems and/or 2 short stories at a time.

<div style="font-size: medium;text-align: left">
We are interested in submissions from new and established writers and every piece will be reviewed by our editorial staff without seeing author names.

<div style="font-size: medium;text-align: left">
We gladly accept simultaneous submissions, but do ask that you alert us if one of your submissions is accepted by another publication.

You will receive a reply to your submissions within three months, but typically much sooner.

We ask for First North American Serial Rights and that you acknowledge Genuine Gold in the event of subsequent publication. At this time we cannot offer payment for publishing your work.

Submissions are now open and will be accepted until September 30. The inaugural issue of Genuine Gold will be published during the fourth quarter of 2021 in both print and ebook formats.
