<h1>WB Pizza</h1>
<p>Where do I begin? WB Pizza looks like it has been carved out of the back room of a bowling alley. The dining area is about 12 inches by 12 inches, which is not much space, but if my experience is anything, 12 inches is all you need. *wink wink* This small area does not convey the beauty that is the kitchen because the kitchen makes some damn fine pizza. I happily consumed The Grant Park (it’s the name of the pizza, not the real Grant Park. Duh) and some fantastic Stuffed Bread Sticks.</p>
<p>When I was a kid, I always thought that using a knife and fork for pizza was something that old people did. They didn’t have the strength to hold the pizza, so they needed to cut it up. It never occurred to me that they needed a certain level of strength to hold the knife and fork, but I was a dumb kid. Now I know that if you need a knife and fork for a pizza, it's because it is good, usually. If you find yourself eating a pizza with a knife and fork and it isn’t good, then you are getting Punk'd. Look for Ashton Kutcher.</p>
<p>The Grant Park is a knife and fork pizza. One deserving of a gold knife and a gold fork. I believe that they grew every topping on this pizza in the garden out back. Every topping stood on its own, while also being a team player. Not to mention the crust. It is a special dish itself. This is one of the first times I have ever thought to eat the pizza backwards. But I ate it normally, keeping my eye on the crust at the other end. It’s like all of the other things in life that have a great ending: a well executed workout plan or a flight to Tahiti. Many places try to make their crust as good as their pizza, but not many can.</p>
<p>WB Pizza doesn’t look like much from the outside, but like all great holes-in-the-wall, it has it where it counts. It's a little spot and when you find it, you will love it.</p>
