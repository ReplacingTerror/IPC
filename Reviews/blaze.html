<h1>Blaze</h1>
<p>Have you ever wanted a Subway style pizza place? A place where you can choose the sauce that you want, the cheese that you need, and add what ever topping you want? A place where you can argue on the how much bacon is too much bacon? Well Blaze is the right place for you. It works like an assembly line. Pick your sauce, pick your cheese, (get the goat cheese, it comes from their boobs), and then convince them that three scopes of bacon will not compromise the structural integrity of the crust. After that, they throw it in the oven and its done in 180 seconds, hence the name Blaze. The combinations are endless. You can get a simple cheese pizza. A cheese pizza with bacon. A Meatlovers pizza that has more meat on it then the animal it came from originally. You want a pizza with goat cheese, artichokes, bacon, and salame? They got that! A pizza with only vegetables? They got it!  You want a pizza with spicy red sauce, ricotta, jalapenos, and red pepper? They got that! You want a pumpkin spice pizza? They don't got that. Thatâ€™s a horrible idea. Why would you even suggest that? Get out of here.</p>
<p>The prices are just as good as their pizza. Pick it up for lunch one day and eat it at your desk. Make your coworkers jealous.</p>
