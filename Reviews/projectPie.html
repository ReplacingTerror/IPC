<h1>Project Pie</h1>
<p>Do you remember when you had to do group projects in school? Someone would inevitably do all the work and I would take the credit. Project Pie is like that. You walk in, tell the young person what you want done, and then pretend that eating the entire thing is an accomplishment. Similar to other restaurant/fast food joints, Project Pie puts you in charge of telling someone else how to make your pizza. Their staff is more than willing to indulge your excessive use of a topping. Here is a fun game, go to Project Pie and ask them to put every topping they have on your pizza and see if they will.</p>
<p>Three handfuls of bacon, please and thank you.</p>
<p>If you happen to take your eyes off the pizza you will notice the restaurant. It reminds me of a time when I got a label maker and decided to labeled everything I could find. Their wall of quotes reminds me of high school but that is a different story for a different time.</p>
<p>The process of "making" your own pizza is great and I'm glad that Indianapolis has two places that do that.</p>
<p>Did I mention they serve beer? Well, they do.</p>
