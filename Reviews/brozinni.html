<h1>Brozinni</h1>
<p>The Brozinni façade does not convey the true beauty inside. Going to Brozinni is completely worth it. They have your standard Italian fare. They have something called garlic knuckles. I have always been told that the garlic knuckles are worth killing someone for, but I don’t see it. I like them. They are good, but they are not the hill to die on. The pizza is where it is at, he said youthfully. Half Margherita and Half Meat. Or as Brozinni calls it, half Garden State Parkway and half Park Avenue. Brozinni’s has a New York City theme. They name every pizza after a street or boulevard or homeless person in New York city. Which is weird because Greenwood is world-renowned like methamphetamines are world-renowned. Sorry if you are from Greenwood... kinda. The pizza came grandma style, which means the sauce is mostly chunky tomatoes and it makes you feel guilty when you don't call now and then.</p>
<p>Grandma style is odd, it sacrifices sauce in parts of the pizza, for giant chunks of tomato. Which I am perfectly fine with, but I was curious. I asked about the history of the Grandma’s style I wonder how they came up with that……….</p>
<p>Son currently on the phone: I don’t know what to do. She isn’t herself anymore.</p>
<p>*person on phone mumbles something*</p>
<p>Son: No, I don’t think it is Alzheimer's.</p>
<p>*person on phone mumbles something*</p>
<p>Son: She is perfectly fine the rest of the time. Its only when she is cooking.</p>
<p>*person on phone mumbles something*</p>
<p>Son: I could try that.</p>
<p>*LOUD CRASH*</p>
<p>Son: Sorry I have to go.</p>
<p>*Son hangs up phone*</p>
<p>Son: Mom are you ok?</p>
<p>Mom: Funkin Jimmy Carter.</p>
<p>Son: What? Who are you talking to?</p>
<p>Mom: Sammy Davis Jr, You Ass.</p>
<p>Son: Watch your language.</p>
<p>Mom: Watch your language. “She said in a mocking tone.’</p>
<p>Son: What are you doing?</p>
<p>Mom: Making pizza.</p>
<p>Son: But you are using just a tomato</p>
<p>And that is the story of grandmas style.</p>
<p>The place is fantastic and the Pizza is great make the trek and go.</p>
<p>Quick aside, why are grandparents so much cooler than your real parents? Do they just not give a shit anymore? Did their fight with the Nazi’s prepare them for whatever stupid shit we have to deal with now? They lived through the latter half of the craziest century. They don’t care what they say. They don’t care who you marry, they were born before Hawaii was a state. They care about your dead phone like Michigan cares about lead poisoning. Ok enough of that.</p>
