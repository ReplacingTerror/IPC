<h1>Boombozz</h1>
<p>This is my second time to Boombozz, but my first time for Indiana Pizza Club. Both times it has been completely packed. Wall-to-Wall people. The music was loud, everyone is dancing, a glowstick in each hand. Some guy named Preston hands me a dollar bill with sugar on it.... whoops, wrong club. Boombozz always seems to be packed, and after eating their pizza, it is easy to know why. We got an All Meats Classic and a Old World Style Margherita, our standard fare. The basil was fresh on the Margherita and the pieces of meats were small, which blended them together perfectly. Boombozz always has local beer on tap, which I very much appreciate.</p>
<p>I have heard that the wings are especially good, but I have not tried them for a review yet, so the jury is still out.</p>
