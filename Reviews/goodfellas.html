<h1>Goodfella’s</h1>
<p>I want you to know that I was surprised by Goodfella's. It's Pizza from Wabash, a city that is not known for Pizza, or maybe it is and I just don't know that. The building it’s in is not that big. It looks like a little barn that was the meeting place for the Teamsters that operated out of the abandoned train yard across the street. My hopes weren't high going into this place, but it surprised me, like a punch to the gut that knocks you out and you wake up 4 hours later wearing cement shoes.</p>
<p>First off, they were very accommodating. The place isn't that big, but they gathered as many tables as they could and sat us all together. I felt like Ray Liotta in that scene in Goodfellas (no relation) where he walks into the back of the Copacabana and a table is set up for him right in front of the stage. Only the stage in this scenario was the counter where you order.</p>
<p>We took our time looking over the menu. All of the menu items are named using various Mafia terms, such as "The Boss", "The Copacabana", and "The Skinny". The Skinny is described as being a burrito shell, Pizza sauce, all of the vegetables, and cheese (meat is optional).  I got The Don, a meaty Pizza. Most of the other Pizza consumed on the tour did not have many types of meat. I wanted some bacon. It was good. The meat was standard fare, not to say it's bad, but if you mess up a meat Pizza, something is wrong with you. The crust is where it’s at my friends. It was light and fluffy. Imagine a Pizza crust made of fluffy, butter rolls.</p>
<p>The whole thing was fantastic. It scored a 8.1/10. I would definitely eat it again. Some other members of the club got a small deep dish, which looked like a Pizza pot pie. We also tried a pepperoni Pizza on their cauliflower crust. Goodfellas was the perfect place to end Indiana Pizza Tour 2017. This experience solidified my desire to continue on with Pizza Club. Indiana has some great Pizza. You just have to spend the time to find it.</p>

<p>P.S. Prior to the tour, I sent out a short email survey to the Pizza places we were going to visit. Goodfellas was the only one to respond. Here are the questions I asked and the answers they gave.</p>
<p>1. When did you start in the Pizza Industry?</p>
<p>Our business opened in November of 2003.</p>
<p>2. What is your favorite thing about running a Pizza place?</p>
<p>We are a mom and pop business - not part of any chain.  My husband and I have lived in Wabash our entire lives and enjoy working with the public.</p>
<p>3. What is your favorite Pizza?</p>
<p>My favorite pizza is the Club pizza with a salad dressing sauce. I also love my new homemade Cauliflower crust pizza.</p>
<p>4. We know Chicago style and New York style, but how would you describe Wabash style pizza?</p>
<p>Nothing is measured or weighed when we make a pizza- so each pizza is different!  That's what we call the Wabash style!</p>
<p>5. If you could share a Pizza with any three people from history,  who would you choose?</p>
<p>Because we have named our pizzas after Mafia terms, ( I work in Law enforcement) I suppose I would like to get feedback from a few of the Mafia pizza connoisseurs.</p>
