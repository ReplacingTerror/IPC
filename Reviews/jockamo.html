<p>If someone told me as a child that you can do half and half with stuff, I think that I would be in a better place now. I was always under the impression that you had to get a whole of something. It was only recently that I found out that you can half and half something. I should have figured it out sooner, all great things are half and half. Tea and Lemonade, Centaurs and Minotaurs, Jack and Coke, these things are great and I have one more to add to the list. Pizza! Do you know that you can get pizza in a half and half format? Do you want half pepperoni and half sausage? Done. Do you want half a pizza to have 5 different types of delicious meat and the other half to have delicious tomato pesto, basil and garlic. Thus simultaneously pleasing both omnivores and vegetarians and pissing off all vegans? DONE!</p>
<p>Going to Jockamo Pizza and getting both the Slaughterhouse Five (pepperoni, Italian sausage, sliced steak, ham, and bacon) and the Caprese (sun-dried tomato pesto, basil, mozzarella, and garlic) is the second best decision you can make on a Saturday. The first being going to a soccer game and yelling at the refs. The buttery crust of the pizza delivered everything nicely. Proving once more that pizza crust is the worlds greatest plate</p>
