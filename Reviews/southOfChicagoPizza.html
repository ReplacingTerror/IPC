<h1>South of Chicago Pizza</h1>
<p>What can I say about South of Chicago Pizza that hasn't already been said about another pizza place that I have reviewed?</p>
<p>Before I start, I need to make one thing clear. This is good pizza. In fact, it is great pizza. It deserves a spot on your pizza tour of Indianapolis. I ordered two 14" Deep Dish Chicago Style Pizzas. We, however, did not receive Deep Dish Chicago Style Pizzas. We got a non-deep dish, regular Chicago style Pizza. It was 40% crust, 60% toppings and sauce. It sat about an inch high. It wasn't deep dish. You can't call something an inch thick, deep. Amirite ladies? Deep Dish Pizza is a knife and fork affair. You are not suppose to be able to pick up a piece and eat it. That's not how Deep Dish works.</p>
<p>I did not have the thin crust. I don't know if it bypasses standard social conventions of pizza construction, but I will bet that it is a delicious pizza. Now I don't know if this is how they intended it to be or they just don't know how Deep Dish is done. I like to think that they know what they are doing and this is just their rendition of the classic that people love. Like Rupert Wyatt's Rise of the Planet of the Apes and not Tim Burton's Planet of the Apes.</p>
<p>My suggestion to you is to go try the pizza. It is honestly really good pizza. Leave your stereotypes about pizza at the door and have their delicious pizza. Unless of course you hate Chicago sports teams because that is the only thing they have as wall decorations. Every piece of art and every photo is about Chicago. One of their waiters even looks like Rod Blagojevich.</p>
