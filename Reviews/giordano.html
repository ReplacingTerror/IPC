<h1>Giordano</h1>
<p>There is a special moment that occurs when you order one of Giordano's stuffed pizza's. It's called "The Wait". It's the time between ordering your Giordano's Stuffed Pizza and getting it. It's a time of turmoil and welcomed anticipation. It happens in five steps.</p>
<p>Ordering - After spending the time deciding what you want on your pizza, you put in your order.</p>
<p>Light conversation with a trickle of doubt - You begin a normal conversation with the person/people you are with, but in the back of your mind you start to realize that you have never made a real decision before that would take this long to manifest itself. Coffee takes 3 minutes to get from ordering stage to your hand and you can barely handle that. You begin to lose focus on the conversation.</p>
<p>Screaming through your eyes - The conversation is lost. Your brain begins to scream. IS CHEESE AND BACON ALL YOU WANT ON IT? IS THAT IT? You start to look for an exit. You grab your jacket. You tell your company "I'm cold and I need to go to the bathroom." You head for the exit but there is a server in your way. She gives you a polite smile and says "Hello." You collapse to the floor and for a brief second you wonder why no one ever properly prepared you for this. Why don't they teach you how to make decisions in school? You curse them for not preparing you for life or the 45 minute wait time for a pizza. You quickly gather yourself, telling the server. "I tripped‚Äù You know that the jig is up. They know you more than you know yourself. You rush back to your booth, sit down and wait for the end.</p>
<p>Resolved to your fate - You come to the realization that whatever is going to happen is going to happen. You have rolled your dice and whatever comes up is your number. Checking the time you see that the pizza will be out any second now. Like a raccoon staring into a headlight, you accept it.</p>
<p>Profit $$$$$</p>
<p>The Chicago style deep dish is delicious. Get a large and you can eat for a week.</p>
