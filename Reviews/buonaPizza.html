<h1>Buona Pizza</h1>
<p>You ever exit the hustle and bustle of Broadway and pop into your favorite New York City Pizza joint to grab a hot slice?</p>
<p>Me neither.</p>
<p>I've never been to New York and never plan to. I'm from the Midwest and big cities give me anxiety.</p>
<p>However, I have experienced the Pizza eating habits of a true New Yorker by eating lunch at Buona Pizza on 75th & Shadeland Avenue in Indianapolis. As everyone knows, Indianapolis is Indiana's version of NYC and Shadeland and 75th is like Times Square...or so I assume.</p>
<p>Buona Pizza sells hot Pizza by the slice. Mainly basic toppings like pepperoni, sausage, etc. are offered. They have great breadsticks (plain or pepperoni-filled) with your choice of cheese or marinara dipping sauce. [Pro Tip: Get the cheese sauce and then pour some of it on top of your Pizza for an even cheesier treat.]</p>
<p>Buona offers a lunch deal that gets you two humongous slices of Pizza (it is really 4 slices), two breadsticks, dipping sauce, and a soft drink for like $8 and some change. Not too shabby.</p>
<p>The folks who work at Buona are super-nice and the restaurant is clean...none of those NYC Pizza rats here!</p>
<p>So, if you need a lunch treat on the Northside of Indy, choose Buona and fahgettaboudit!</p>
<p>Listen to me - I sound like a real New Yorker!</p>
