<h1>Ale Emporium</h1>
   <p>What can I say about the pizza that has everything? Bacon, pepperoni, sausage, bacon, cheese, and bacon. This pizza would kill a lesser being.</p>
   <p>Cheese and bacon is what I got. Satisfaction and a bigger pant size is what I left with. It's hard for an Ale Emporium pizza to disappoint anyone or ruin your day. I once saw a waitress spill a pizza into someones lap. The customer ate it anyway, right off their jeans. True story. Look it up*. The Ale Emporium is 21 and over. Which is bad if you want to try their pizza and are underage. Unless, you are like me and hate dealing with those loudmouth drunk toddlers. Holy crap what is their problem? I’m mean I get that you think the world is gone when your mom plays peek-a-boo with you but you don’t have to ruin it for everyone by getting drunk and starting fights with everyone in the bar. Damn…… Sorry. Back to the pizza.  The pan pizza (which I got) is something to write home to mom about. It’s large and in charge, but like a raccoon in a business suit, late for his 9 am meeting, treat it with the respect it desires and you will go home with the same joy and sense of accomplishment that you get from doing that thing that mommies and daddies do. You know. That thing. *wink, wink*  Also, try their Hermanaki wings and go home fat and happy.</p>
   <p>*Don’t look it up.</p>
