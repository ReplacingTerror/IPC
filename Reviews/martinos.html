<h1>Martino’s</h1>
<p>What can I say about Martino's that hasn’t already been said about a Totino's frozen Pizza?</p>
<p>WHAT!??!? Shut your flubber mouth!</p>
<p>Sorry, but it’s true.</p>
<p>Now that I got my gut feeling out, I want to bring up something that I have always thought, but could never prove. Stick with me. It will make sense in a minute. Time for the scientific method....</p>
<p>First up, the hypothesis. I think that when you order a small Pizza at a restaurant, you don't get the full flavor and taste as the large size of the same Pizza. The crust is not a full crust. Pizza is never developed to come in a small. It is developed with its size in mind *wink wink*. The toppings are not measured out to fit a small. They are measured for a large Pizza. When it comes to a small Pizza, they play it all by ear. They try to determine what a small crust would be and then they over compensate with toppings. The proportions are all off.</p>
<p>Martino's cheese was great. The cheese, as we all know, is the glue. It flows through the Pizza. It’s what binds it. I feel like I have heard that from somewhere, but I can't think of it right now. Anyway, Martino’s cheese was on point, and the crust was good, which makes me think that I ordered the wrong size. The toppings and sauce were suspect to me. Not in their origins, but in the volume. The sausage was fine ground, which I know is a thing, but it reminded me of a frozen Pizza. The onions, olives, and peppers were not particularly warm, like they were thrown on after the Pizza was brought out of the oven. Maybe that is also a thing. It wouldn't make them soggy. Again, it reminded me of a frozen Pizza. Now that I think about it, the thing that stands out about Martino's is that it reminded me of a frozen Pizza.</p>
<p>Hmmmmmm.........</p>
<p>That's it. The Pizza wasn't bad. It wasn't undercooked. It had redeeming qualities. The place itself looks like an old timey Italian restaurant you would see in a gangster movie. I sat at the head of the table and looked at a mural of an Italian villa created in the wrong perspective. Everyone who worked there was nice. They were able to accommodate a group of 10 no problem, fa-get-abot-it. Does this all sound like justification for dragging 10+ IPC members to Kokomo, which let's face it, why would you go to Kokomo? *wipes laugh tear from face* I mean yes, this might sound like justification, but I think I may have ordered the wrong size. I didn't know what to order. We had originally planned three Pizza stops over 2 days. We made arrangements to stay at an Airbnb overnight. Where was I going to put the leftovers? Martino's being the first stop taught me a few things about how I should plan the next Indiana Pizza Tour. The bottom line is that I don't think I gave Martino's a fair visit. So the next time I find myself in Kokomo, I'm going to stop by Martino's and grab a larger pie.</p>
