<h1>Bruno’s</h1>
<p>My review will not be a typical one. Normally, I eat the Pizza at the establishment, but not this time. This Pizza was had during Indiana Pizza Tour 2017. When we landed at our Airbnb in South Bend, we decided to get Pizza from three different places instead of going only to one. This review will focus on just the Pizza.</p>
<p>Before I start, here is what other members thought:</p>
<p>“Great family atmosphere and cheese” says Prof. C. Rust and Bonnie Lawless</p>
<p>“It had crust” says Franky “Two Shoes”</p>
<p>Overall, the Bruno’s Pizza seemed pretty popular. Of the 6 Pizzas bought that evening, only one was finished in its entirety. That was the pepperoni Pizza from Bruno’s.</p>
<p>As for me, I was half way through a piece of Bruno’s Pizza and thought to myself “this is salty”. I set it down and moved on to one of the other pies.</p>
<p>So yeah……..</p>
<p>This is awkward…..</p>
