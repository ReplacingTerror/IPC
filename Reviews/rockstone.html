<h1>Rockstone</h1>
<p>Someone hid Rockstone Pizzaria & Pub from me. I want to know who did it! Todd? Robert? Jance? I bet it was you, Jance. I bet it was because you have a weird name and you want everyone else to suffer. Well your name is not my fault, so don't take it out on me. I am glad that it is no longer hidden. It is situated in a tiny strip at Allisonville and 116th street. Rockstone understands how to be a modern pizzaria without being overbearing with a hipster motif. The pizza was fantastic. We got the Deluxious (wood-fired) and writing about it makes me want to get more. The bell peppers were fresh and the crimini mushrooms were good enough to make me retract any previous statement I may have made about mushrooms.</p>
<p>Now I am going to say something that might go against the conventional pizza thought. When we were there, we also got the Fresca, seen here. I know what you are thinking, that doesn't really look like a pizza. If the Italians knew we were doing this, they might declare war on us, but it is a delicious pizza. Fresh basil pesto, peperonata, fresh spinach, fresh mozzarella, ricotta (not fresh I guess), goat cheese (apparently not fresh), and fresh arugula (fresh) make up that salad mix with a pizza crust plate. How can you go wrong with these ingredients? You can't. Unless they are days old and not fresh. FYI I just wrote the word fresh 10 times. Hopefully it's starting to look weird and misspelled for you.</p>
<p>So yes, maybe I broke one of the cardinal rules of pizza loving, but I don't regret it. I highly recommend Rockstone Pizzaria & Pub. They have a lot of options for pizza. It might take you a while to try them all.</p>
