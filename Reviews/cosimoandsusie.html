<h1>Cosimo & Susie’s A Bit Italy</h1>
<p>My review will not be a typical one. Normally, I eat the Pizza at the establishment, but not this time. This Pizza was had during Indiana Pizza Tour 2017. When we landed at our Airbnb in South Bend, we decided to get a Pizza from three different places instead of going only to one.</p>
<p>Cosimo & Susie's is the Pizza I was responsible for picking up so I can give my thoughts on what I briefly saw. The restaurant is located in a strip mall. Strip malls are not known for baller Pizza. Inside, it was dark and small. Too small to handle all of the IPC members that came along on the tour. Luckily, we dodged that. We would have had to push for more elbow room. It was nice and cozy, which I think was the purpose. You come with your friends or family. You put your fracking phones away and talk to people. We paid for the pies and left.</p>
<p>When we got back to the house, we found a large assortment of Pizza. We had a total of 6 Pizzas and 3 orders of breadsticks. This experience was not for someone on a diet.</p> 
<p>*Side note* I find a certain enjoyment that I was able to derail any diet that my fellow Pizza Club members had.</p>
<p>On to the Pizza. It was good. The crust was nice and crispy, yet doughy. It can be compared to a Papa John's crust, which might seem like an insult, but I’ll choose a independent Pizzeria over Papa John’s any day of the week. Sorry, Papa.</p>
<p>If I ever find myself in South Bend again, I’m going to take my First Lady and grab a pie at Cosimo & Susie’s. I’ll be sure to ask for the back corner, a bottle of wine, and I’ll treat my queen.</p>
