<h1>Pizzology</h1>
<p>We had half of a Margherita and half of a Pepperoni Piquante and damn was it good. The Piquante had just enough kick to make you want more, like a little love tap. The Margherita was an excellent rendition of the classic pizza. The pizza was fantastic. The pepperoni's were crisp and spicy. The cheese was amazing and the crust was a team player, not trying to stand out and not trying to ruin anything. The Basil and Oregano was so fresh it still had plans for the weekend.</p>
<p>The atmosphere was just right. Most places play up the indie vibe to the point of pandering. Pizzology gets it right. Soft indie music, table cloths (made of packing paper), and menus that were just pieces of paper secured to a block of wood with a rubber band. Walls covered in words that I think were connected into a paragraph but because it was inturupped by doors and windows it was impossible to read. It was something about farms and freshness.</p>
<p>There is a certain level of pretentious with using the suffix of -logy in naming something. They seem to think that they are a new science and require the same level of respect as others, I’m looking at you sociology. Pizzology makes the grade. They are able to combine a heavy Italian influence with local Indiana ingredients. How do they do it? I don’t know but I shall dedicate my life to this beautiful science.</p>
