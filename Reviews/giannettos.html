<h1>Giannetto’s</h1>
<p>My review will not be a typical one. Normally, I eat the Pizza at the establishment, but not this time. This Pizza was had during Indiana Pizza Tour 2017. When we landed at our Airbnb in South Bend, we decided to get a Pizza from three different places instead of going only to one. This review will focus on just the Pizza.</p>
<p>I found this place after looking through a magazine left at the Airbnb. It was just an image of a deep dish Pizza that took up a whole page. I simply opened the magazine and there it was, like a sign. There was a caption to the image stating that it was voted best Pizza in St. Joseph county in 2015. Ok, magazine. Enough of the arm twisting. We will get one of those. So our original plan to get only one Pizza from one place was quickly replaced with us getting six Pizzas from 3 different places.</p>
<p>From Giannetto’s, we ordered a Pepperoni Pizza and a Veggie Pizza with spinach, both of the stuffed variety. They were fantastic. The large, thick cuts of pepperoni layered at the bottom of the pie were delicious, and the veggies were fresh and tasty. These were top quality Chicago Style Pizzas. “Giannetto’s is exemplary Chicago Style” raved Bonnie Lawless and Prof. C. Rust.</p>
<p>Normally, I’m not into putting numerical scores in these reviews, but I sent out a survey after the tour to find out what people thought of each place. Giannetto’s scored a 7.8 out of 10, which is great. It was placed as the 2nd best Pizza on the tour. One person even said it was their number 1 Pizza.</p>
<p>Definitely put Giannetto’s on your to do list if you visit South Bend.</p>
