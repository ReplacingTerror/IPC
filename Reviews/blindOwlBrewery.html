<h1>Blind Owl Brewery</h1>
<p>This will not be a typical review. I was attending a friend's graduation party and was too busy getting drunk and talking to give the pizza its proper time. I was also going around and putting my GoPro in various drinks. I know what you are thinking, but don't worry. The drink touching was for research purposes.</p>
<p>I got "The Brewer". Italian sausage, pepperoni, banana peppers, red onion, and cheese blend on a hand tossed crust. It was delicious. The banana peppers were really guiding the taste. That's as much as I can remember. I will return and give their pizza a proper review.</p>
