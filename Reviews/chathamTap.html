<h1>Chatham Tap</h1>
<p>If you go to Chatham Tap you are there for either the Soccer (European football) or you like going places that look like Winston Churchill might have been there once. You may not necessarily go for the pizza but if you need pizza it’s not a bad place. It may not win any awards but it does make the list of good pizza. This is not something that Chatham Tap will like to hear, but that is what I am saying. Get the small meat, the pizza is small not the meat. It is great. I give it 6 Lorries out of 10 Disraeli’s.</p>
