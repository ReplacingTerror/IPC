<p style="font-size: medium; text-align:left; text-indent:50px; line-height:1.6; margin:0">Last week we placed our order and the Colts delivered! We got One Large Win Pizza with the toppings we desired!
<span style="display:inline-block; text-indent: 50px;">We asked for Pass-Defens-Eroni (Pepperoni) and we got it big time. Kirk Cousins had just 113 yards and threw 3 interceptions.</span>
<span style="display:inline-block; text-indent: 50px;">also ordered Jonathan-ions Taylor (Onions) and he showed up big time filling in for Marlon Mack, with 100 yards and a TD. (Side note: We all know about Jonathan Taylor Thomas, but it is time the world met the new JTT. We’re talking about Jonathan Taylor Touchdown. Think we can get that nickname (JTT) to catch on? What do you say Colts fans?)</span>
</p>
<p style="font-size: medium; text-align:left; text-indent:50px; line-height:1.6; margin:0">The only area where they messed up our order was the surprise Injuries on the side. We DID NOT order injuries to Parris Campbell and Malik Hooker. Don’t make us call up the manager!
<span style="display:inline-block; text-indent: 50px;">This week the Colts take on the lowly NY Jets. The Jets are 0-2 and look like possibly the worst team in the NFL. Not only does Indiana have a better football team that NY, but we have better pizza as well. We’ll put up our state’s pizza against New York’s anyday. FUGGETABOUTIT!</span>
<span style="display:inline-block; text-indent: 50px;">We think that Philip Rivers and the boys can lay down another whoopin this week.</span>

<p style="font-size: medium; text-align:left; margin:10">
Here it goes!
</p>

<p style="font-size: medium; text-align:left; margin:10">Our order: One Large Win Pizza - We’ll order this every week. But it is the toppings that make it special.</p>

<h3 style="text-align:left;">TOPPINGS:</h3>

<p style="font-size: medium; text-align:left; margin:10">
    Extra MoAlieNara Sauce (Mo Alie-Cox) - Not technically a topping, but last week we tasted how sweet it was when Alie-Cox had 111 yards on 5 receptions and we’d like some more of that this week. Heck, maybe even throw in a touchdown while you’re at it!
</p>

<p style="font-size: medium; text-align:left; margin:10">
    Olives with Pitts, Man! (Michael Pittman) - Pittman is showing that he can contribute as a rookie, but we feel he can do a bit more than his 47 total yards receiving through Week 2. And while we usually don’t like to eat olives with the pits in them on our pizza, we think that serving pitted olives to the Jets might be just the thing to give their coach Gase-strointestinal problems. 
</p>

<h3 style="text-align:left;">
    SIDES:
</h3>

<p style="font-size: medium; text-align:left; margin:10">
    We’re asking for a heavy amount of offense toppings this week, so we’ll order our side in a sack. Actually, we’ll order a sack of Sack Sticks. Last week the Bills sacked Sam Darnold 3 times. That’s pretty good, but this week let’s order 4 Sack Sticks and a little Forced Fumble Sauce to go with it. Let’s knock that ball out of their underachieving QB’s hands! 
</p>

<p style="font-size: medium; text-align:left; margin:10">
So that is our order. It has been placed. And now we wait.
</p>

<p style="font-size: medium; text-align:left; margin:10">
Will the Colts deliver our pizza and get our order correct for a hot and tasty win? ...we’ll soon find out.
