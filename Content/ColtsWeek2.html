    In Week 1, the Colts got our order all wrong. We ordered a Large Win with Extra Scoring and instead we got a Large Loss with Extra Anchovies &amp; Two Interception Sticks with Disappointment Sauce for dipping. So starting this week, and going forward, we are going to be extra clear each week regarding what we’d like to have delivered by our Colts.</span>
<br><span style="display:inline-block; text-indent: 50px;">This week we take on the also 0-1 Vikings right here in Indianapolis. The Vikings may have put up 34 points against the Packers in Week 1 (including 24 points in the fourth quarter), but they gave up an incredible 43 and the final score doesn’t really do justice to the whooping Aaron Rodgers and Co. put on them.</span>
<br><span style="display:inline-block; text-indent: 50px;">Can Philip Rivers mimic, at least to some degree, the 4 TD/0 INT game Rodgers had last week against Minnesota? We don’t know, but all we can do is place our order.</span>

Here it goes!

One Large Win Pizza - We’ll order this every week. But it is the toppings that make it special.
</p>
<h3 style="text-align:left;">
Toppings:
</h3>
<p style="font-size: medium; text-align:left; margin:10">
Pass-Defens-Eroni (Pepperoni) - Last week Gardner Minshew completed 19/20 passes against the Colts. You can’t let a QB have that kind of completion percentage and expect to win. 
</p>
<p style="font-size: medium; text-align:left; margin:10">
Jonathan-ions Taylor (Onions) - Marlon Mack going down for the season is crushing. However, 2nd Round rookie Jonathan Taylor should be up for the challenge. Last week, he had a fairly solid effort. But this week, with a full week to game plan to his strengths, Taylor should be able to show us why he was drafted so early in April. And don’t forget, this guy can catch the ball too. Remember his 35-yard pass play from last weekend?

We’d like to complement our pizza with an order of 3 Touchdown Sticks and some Hilton Sauce for dipping. We think Rivers can throw for three TDs against a young and inexperienced Minnesota CB group. And let’s dip those TDs in some Hilton Sauce. Last week’s 4 receptions and 53 yards isn’t going to cut it. Hilton has to get involved. 
</p>
<p style="font-size: medium; text-align:left; margin:10">
So that is our order. It has been placed. And now we wait.
</p>
<p style="font-size: medium; text-align:left; margin:10">
Will the Colts deliver our pizza and get our order correct for a hot and tasty win?   ...we’ll soon find out.
